##Algorithm

This part of the blog will focus on the algorithm I used for printing the digital rain to the console 

Starting out I first wanted to print a basic letter to the console. For the digital rain I wanted each letter printed to the console to be random. To do this `cstdlib` library must be included. Once that is done the rand() function can be called.
