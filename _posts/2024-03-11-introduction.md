## Introduction to my C++ Digital Rain Project

This is a blog about my 4th Year C++ Digital Rain Project.
In this blog I will be documenting my experience throughout the project

The vlog is broken into the following sections
  - Algorithm
  - Problem Solving
  - Modern C++
  - Design and Test

This project is about printing a digital rain or "Matrix" affect to the console.
The IDE used in this project is Microsoft Visual Studio. This IDE is ideal for c++ programming due to its c++ extensions as well as its affective ability to help debug code. 
The project code is written using modern C++. This means using modern c++ coding styles like 
  - Using the standard library
  - Using Vectors instead of raw arrays
  - Using standard library algorithms
  - Following the C++ Core Guidelines

The project is programmed using an Object Oriented (OO) design and programming style also.
To achieve this the projects files are broken up into
  - Main.cpp
      - This file will have little code and will be kept clean.
  - Matrix.cpp
      - This file will contain memeber functions or methods definitions.
      - Will be made up of constructors and deconstructors
      - The algorithm used to print the digital rain will be in this file
  - TestMatrix.cpp
      - This will run the function to print to the console, delete and copy constructors
  - Matrix.h
      - This header file will have the matrix class definition
      - Made up of both public and private class member data
  - TestMatrix.h
      - Will declare and create the functions that will run in TestMatrix.cpp
