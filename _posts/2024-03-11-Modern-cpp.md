## Modern CPP

**This part of the blog is about modern c++ and how I used it in my project**

Throughout my project I tried to use modern c++ 
- I use the standard library in many cases. The `<cstdlib>` library is the modern c++ library for random characters
- For my digital rain printing, I use a vector to print out the random characters
- To print out the vector I use a range loop which is apart of modern c++
- In my range loops I use `auto`, `const` and the `&`. These are apart of the modern c++ and used to print out variables and pointers
- The `<thread>` and `<chrono>` libraries are apart of modern c++ brought in c++11. I need these libraries to use the `std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(150)` function to add a delay

Throughtout my project I used modern c++, sometimes without knowing. I think my code can also be improved by adding more moden c++, like using the lambda expression in my algorithm.
