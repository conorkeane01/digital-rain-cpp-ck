##Problem Solving

This part of my blog will be about how I went about problem solving throughout my project.

I came across a lot of problems throughout my project especially when dealing with the object oriented style and algorithm.

A major problem I encountered was with my algorithm. I wanted my digital rain to be like rain and fall from the sceen row by row. For example the first 4 or 5 characters in row 1 would print, then row 2 would start and so on and so forth. Something like this:
a l a j
f q f y
c x h i
h o n 
f w 
b r 
g
v

and so on until all the characters would fill the rows and columns

I based my algorithm around this so I beileved once I got the first row printing, I could repeat the code and have get it working the way I wanted. Due to lack of time and other projects I had to submit, I ran out of time to persue this idea

As I did not have the time I would have to work on a different design and used a nested for loop. This made it so the characters were being printed column by column like how you would write left to right.
c q p d a r f a q f ->
d w r g s q l y ->
d r y u b h ->

This did not give the "rain" affect I wanted
